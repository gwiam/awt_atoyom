# Non-Issues:

    - all models were imported correctly
    - animations imported correctly
    - materials imported correctly
    - the skeleton was translated correctly

# Issues:

    - the gun pivot is controlled by the "EnemyShootBullet" script to always look at the player
    - enemy behavior is completely missing (as expected)
    - audio sources couldn't be imported
    - particles couldn't be imported

# Solutions:

    - rebuild the particle effect

# Personal notes:
    
    - lol the prefab imported correctly now?!
    - the animations got imported correctly too?
